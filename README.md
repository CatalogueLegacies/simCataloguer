# simCataloguer

simCataloguer is a workflow for generating machine-authored text and images from catalogue data. It was created in 2023 as part of the [Arts and Humanities Research Council](https://www.ukri.org/councils/ahrc/) (AHRC) funded project '[Legacies of Catalogue Descriptions and Curatorial Voice: Opportunities for Digital Scholarship](https://cataloguelegacies.github.io/).'
